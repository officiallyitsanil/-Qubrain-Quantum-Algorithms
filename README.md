## ðŸ§ª Algorithms Covered

### 1. Groverâ€™s Algorithm â€“ Quantum Search
Grover's algorithm demonstrates **quadratic speedup** for searching unsorted databases.
- Built for a 2-qubit system
- Oracle-based circuit implementation
- Final histogram output shows |11âŸ© (target state) is most probable

### 2. Shorâ€™s Algorithm â€“ Integer Factorization
Shorâ€™s algorithm showcases the power of quantum computing by factoring large numbers exponentially faster than classical algorithms.
- Simulated factorization of **15 â†’ [3, 5]**
- Uses Qiskit's high-level `Shor` class for rapid prototyping
